Step 1: Boil Water

Decomposition: Fill the kettle with water, turn on the kettle or stove, and wait for the water to boil.

Algorithm: Take a clean kettle, fill it with the required amount of water, plug it in and switch it on, wait until the water reaches boiling point.

Step 2: Prepare the Cup

Decomposition: Get a mug or cup, place a tea bag or loose-leaf tea in an infuser.

Algorithm: Take a clean cup, place a tea bag inside (or use a tea infuser with loose-leaf tea), add sugar or spices if desired.

Step 3: Steep the Tea

Decomposition: Pour the hot water into the cup, let the tea brew for a few minutes.

Algorithm: Pour the boiled water into the cup over the tea bag or infuser, let it steep for 3â€“5 minutes depending on your preferred strength, remove the tea bag or infuser.

Step 4: Add Extras and Serve

Decomposition: Add milk, sugar, honey, or lemon, stir and taste, serve or enjoy.
